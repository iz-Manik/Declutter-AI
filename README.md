# Declutter AI

Declutter AI is an innovative desktop application built to help you organize and manage your file folders effortlessly. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), our tool intelligently sorts and categorizes files on your computer, saving you time and reducing digital clutter.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Automated File Sorting**: Uses IO Agent's Mistral-Large model to analyze and organize files into appropriate folders.
- **Duplicate File Detection**: Finds and safely zips duplicate files before cleanup.
- **Chat with Your Files**: Ask questions about the files in your folder via an integrated AI chat interface.
- **Privacy-Focused**: File processing is done locally; only file metadata (name and type) is shared with the model.
